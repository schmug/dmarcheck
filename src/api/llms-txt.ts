// /llms.txt per https://llmstxt.org — vendor-neutral pointer for LLM
// ingestion. Robots.txt is to crawlers what llms.txt is to LLM training/
// retrieval clients: a single, well-known file that names the canonical
// markdown URLs an LLM should pull instead of scraping rendered HTML.
//
// The structure (H1, blockquote, `## Section` with markdown-link bullets)
// is what the spec mandates and what existing parsers (e.g. the official
// llms.txt parser) expect. Each URL points at a content-negotiated
// markdown rendering that already exists in src/views/markdown.ts.
