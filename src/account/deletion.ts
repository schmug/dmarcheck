//   1. Cancel an active Stripe subscription. THROWS on failure → the caller
//      aborts and NOTHING local is deleted (never orphan an active sub).

//      NOT roll back the local delete (local erasure is the core promise).
//   4. Send a best-effort confirmation email (failure never aborts).
//
// Every external step degrades gracefully when its binding/secret is absent so
// a self-host deploy without Stripe/WorkOS/email still erases local data.
