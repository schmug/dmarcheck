# OSPS Baseline — declared deviations

This document records where dmarcheck intentionally deviates from the
[Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org/)
and the compensating controls that manage the residual risk. Declaring
deviations explicitly is itself an OSPS expectation; this file is the canonical
home for them.

## QA-07.01 — Code change review before merge

**Control:** Changes to the project's source code should be reviewed by a second
person (someone other than the author) before being merged to the primary
branch.

**Deviation:** The `main` branch sets `required_approving_review_count = 0`. The
`main-protection` ruleset does **not** require a blanket approving review on
every PR. This is deliberate: autonomous [Claude Code Routines](routine-pipeline.md)
open and merge low-risk PRs unattended (sourced from triaged, `spec-approved`
issues), and a blanket two-person review requirement would make that pipeline
impossible for a single-maintainer project.

**Why we accept it:** dmarcheck is maintained by one person. A hard
second-reviewer requirement on every change would either halt the autonomous
routine pipeline entirely or reduce "review" to self-approval theater. Instead
of a blanket-but-hollow gate, we run a **path-scoped** human-review gate plus
deterministic automated gating, so review effort concentrates on the
security-sensitive minority of changes.

### Compensating controls

1. **Path-scoped human review (CODEOWNERS).** Any PR whose diff touches a
   security-sensitive path — CI/workflows, `package.json`/lockfile,
   `wrangler.toml`, `SECURITY.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, input validation
   (`src/index.ts`), rate limiting, DB migrations, analyzer modules,
   orchestration, or scoring — requires an approving review from a code owner
   via [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](../.github/CODEOWNERS) and
   `require_code_owner_review`. The riskiest changes always get a human.

2. **Deterministic fail-closed trust gate.** Before any routine auto-merge, a
   six-condition gate (`scripts/routine-gate/`) must pass: issue author in
   allowlist, `spec-approved` label, resolvable `Closes #N`, no risk-path hit,
   ≤250 lines / ≤8 files, and CI green with no scope drift. It fails closed —
   ambiguity escalates to the maintainer, never auto-merges. The gate is always
   executed from `main`, so a PR cannot weaken its own judge.

3. **Required CI status.** Every PR must pass the `check` status (lint,
   typecheck, tests, and a `npm audit --audit-level=high --omit=dev`
   supply-chain gate) before merge. The ruleset also blocks force-pushes and
   branch deletion on `main`.

4. **Per-merge audit trail.** Each auto-merged PR receives a comment containing
   the full gate verdict JSON, giving an immutable record of why each PR was
   allowed to merge.

### Residual risk and the path to closing it

The CODEOWNERS gate is already **enforcing**, not advisory: the
`main-protection` ruleset (ID
[14716629](https://github.com/schmug/dmarcheck/rulesets/14716629)) has
`enforcement: active`, `require_code_owner_review: true`, and an empty
`bypass_actors` list — there is no admin bypass, so a PR touching a
CODEOWNERS-gated path cannot merge without a genuine code-owner approval
regardless of who opened it. What
[#299](https://github.com/schmug/dmarcheck/issues/299) (the bot-identity
split) actually closes is a *self-approval* gap, not an enforcement gap:
routine PRs are authored as **@schmug**, and GitHub forbids self-approval, so
a gated PR the routine opens still needs a genuinely different code owner to
approve it by hand before it can merge. The deterministic gate (control 2)
and required CI (control 3) apply regardless of identity and remain the
active controls for that human-approval step.

Separately, note the one place `required_approving_review_count = 0` really
does mean zero required reviews: a PR that touches **no** CODEOWNERS-gated
path merges with no approving review at all. That is the intended autonomy
carve-out declared as the QA-07.01 deviation above (control 1 only fires on
gated paths) — it is not a residual gap in the CODEOWNERS gate itself.

## Related OSPS controls (passing)

QA-07.01 is a deviation, not a posture. Several adjacent OSPS controls are met,
which is part of why the path-scoped review model above is acceptable:

- **BR-01.01 (input sanitization)** — user-supplied domains are constrained to
  `[a-z0-9.-]` (`normalizeDomain`) and DKIM selectors to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`; HTML
  output never interpolates raw user input into inline `<script>` (see the
  Input-validation notes in `CLAUDE.md` and [THREAT_MODEL.md](../THREAT_MODEL.md)).
- **AC-04.01 (least-privilege CI)** — every GitHub Actions workflow declares an
  explicit top-level `permissions:` block defaulting to `contents: read`, with
  elevation only at the job level where required, and all actions are pinned by
  full commit SHA.

## Adding a new deviation

When a future change knowingly deviates from an OSPS criterion, add a section
here (criterion ID + control + deviation + why + compensating controls) rather
than leaving it undocumented. Reference this file from
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
