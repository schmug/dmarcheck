// Two-project setup: Node pool for existing fast unit tests (DNS and fetch
// are mocked), Workers pool for runtime tests that must exercise the real
// Cloudflare Workers fetch stack. The workers pool exists specifically to
// catch regressions like PR #58/#92 where `redirect: "error"` throws inside
// workerd but works fine in Node's global fetch — a class of bug that has
// slipped past the mocked unit tests twice.
//
// `cloudflareTest()` is the idiomatic plugin form exported by
// `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`; it wires up vitest's pool runner,
// transforms vite config with the workerd module conditions, and inherits
// compatibility flags / bindings from wrangler.toml.
