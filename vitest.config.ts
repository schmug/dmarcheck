// are mocked), Workers pool for runtime tests that must exercise the real
// Cloudflare Workers fetch stack. The workers pool exists specifically to

// workerd but works fine in Node's global fetch — a class of bug that has
// slipped past the mocked unit tests twice.

// transforms vite config with the workerd module conditions, and inherits
